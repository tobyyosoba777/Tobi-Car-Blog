DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents
It represents the page in a tree structure so that programs can read, access and change the document
structure, style and content

The DOM is an object oriented representation of the webpage which can be modified with a scripting
language such as JavaScript

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure
and content of a document on the web



What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page
so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the
document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source.
In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it
to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a
scripting language such as JavaScript.

For example, the DOM specifies that the querySelectorAll method in this code snippet must return a list
of all the <p> elements in the document:

const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
// paragraphs[0] is the first <p> element
// paragraphs[1] is the second <p> element, etc.
alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);
